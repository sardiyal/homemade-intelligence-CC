# International Situation Intelligence Stack

### Version 2.0 — Updated March 2026

**A Professional Reference for Geopolitical, Economic, Financial, Energy & Narrative Monitoring**

> **Purpose:** This document provides a curated, analytically structured source architecture for monitoring the international situation across politics, economics, finance, energy markets, non-Western perspectives, predictive indexes, Trump behavior forecasting, and AI-driven information manipulation.
>
> **Methodology:** Sources are organized by *analytical function* — what type of knowledge each reliably produces — rather than by topic alone. Cross-referencing across layers is where the highest-value intelligence emerges. No single source is treated as authoritative; triangulation across ideologically and geographically distinct outlets is the core discipline.
>
> **Version 2.0 Update Rationale:** This revision was triggered by the analytical stress-test performed during the February 28, 2026 US-Israel joint strike on Iran (Operation Epic Fury). That event exposed four critical gaps in v1.0: (1) absence of energy-specific intelligence sources despite the Strait of Hormuz being the primary economic risk vector; (2) missing Persian-language and Iranian civil society sources required for internal Iranian political dynamics; (3) no “compound vulnerability” analytical framework for identifying optimal strike windows; (4) no “negotiation-as-pretext” heuristic for decoding diplomacy-before-military-action patterns. All four are addressed in this version.

## I. Geopolitics & Strategic Affairs

**Role:** Addresses structural forces shaping international order — power competition, security alliances, regional conflicts, and state behavior. These sources operate on longer analytical cycles (weeks to months) and provide the *strategic framework* within which daily news events should be interpreted.

> **v2.0 Addition:** The Arms Control Association (ACA) has been added following the Iran strike analysis. It proved to be the highest-signal source for understanding the nuclear-diplomatic dimension of the conflict — particularly the “negotiation-as-pretext” pattern — and has no substitute in the existing stack.

## II. Political News — Western Anglophone

**Role:** Primary record sources — used for *what happened*, not necessarily *why*. This is the raw feed layer. These outlets differ in editorial lean and sourcing access; bias should be treated as an analytical variable, not a disqualifier.

> **Triangulation principle:** No single outlet should be treated as definitive. Compare coverage of the same event across ideologically distinct outlets to separate contested narrative from established fact.

> **v2.0 Note:** NPR (National Public Radio) and PBS NewsHour have been added. Both proved essential for the Iran strike event — NPR broke Day 2 casualty reporting with CENTCOM (US Central Command) sourcing; PBS provided the most complete record of Trump’s 47-year grievance framing, which is analytically important for understanding the stated vs. actual objectives divergence.

## III. Economics & Policy

**Role:** Analyzes macroeconomic trends, trade flows, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and structural economic shifts. Institutional sources (IMF, World Bank, BIS) are the authoritative baseline; academic and think tank sources provide analytical interpretation across all major economic schools.

> **v2.1 Update — Economic School Balance:** Section III has been expanded to include right-leaning and libertarian think tanks (AEI, Cato, Heritage, Hoover) alongside centrist/empirical outlets (NBER, Econbrowser). These additions address a structural bias in the v2.0 source set, which over-represented Keynesian and institutionalist perspectives. **No single school's conclusions should be treated as universal fact.** Cross-school triangulation — identifying where schools agree and where they diverge — produces more reliable analysis than defaulting to any single framework.

**Key terms:**

- *Fiscal policy* — government spending and taxation decisions
- *Monetary policy* — central bank decisions on interest rates and money supply
- *EM (Emerging Markets)* — developing economies with rapidly growing financial markets
- *Economic school* — a coherent theoretical framework for understanding how economies work; major schools include Keynesian (demand-management), Monetarist (money supply focus), Supply-Side (incentive/tax-cut led growth), and Heterodox (MMT, Austrian, Institutional)

### C. Supply-Side / Monetarist / Austrian (Right-leaning)

> **Usage note:** These sources apply incentive-based and market-mechanism frameworks that complement — and frequently contradict — Keynesian interpretations. Use to identify where supply-side logic produces different predictions, not to adjudicate which school is correct. Cross-school divergence is itself a signal of genuine analytical uncertainty.

## IV. Energy, Commodities & Chokepoint Intelligence

*(NEW SECTION — v2.0)*

**Role:** Energy markets are the most direct transmission mechanism between geopolitical events and global economic consequences. This section addresses a critical gap in v1.0, exposed by the February 2026 Iran strike event: the Stack had no dedicated energy intelligence layer despite the Strait of Hormuz being the world’s single most important oil and gas chokepoint. During the Iran strike event, the absence of these sources meant the most consequential economic risk vector — Hormuz closure — was not adequately monitored in real time.

**Key terms:**

- *Chokepoint* — a narrow strategic waterway through which a disproportionate share of global trade must pass; examples include the Strait of Hormuz (oil/gas), the Suez Canal (general cargo), and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait (Red Sea access)
- *bbl/d (barrels per day)* — standard measurement of oil production or flow rate
- *LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)* — natural gas cooled to liquid form for ocean transport; highly price-sensitive to shipping disruptions
- *War risk premium* — additional insurance surcharge applied to vessels operating in conflict zones; functions as a de-facto shipping deterrent even absent physical closure

> **Hormuz Reference Data** *(updated from EIA 2024-2025 data)*:
>
> - ~20 million bbl/d transit daily — approximately 20% of global seaborne oil consumption
> - ~20–21% of global LNG trade transits the strait
> - 84% of Hormuz crude flows go to Asian markets; China, India, Japan, and South Korea account for a combined 69% of volumes
> - The strait is also a chokepoint for 25–35% of globally traded ammonia and urea (key fertilizer precursors)
> - Closure tail-risk scenario: analysts estimate an 11 million bbl/d net supply impact — a shock comparable to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in energy market terms

### B. Commodity Markets — Agricultural Exposure

> **v2.0 Lesson:** The Iran strike event revealed that Hormuz disruption cascades into fertilizer markets — a secondary exposure systematically underreported in geopolitical analysis. Ammonia and urea (fertilizer precursors) represent 25–35% of globally traded volumes transiting Hormuz. Agricultural commodity portfolios must be monitored alongside energy portfolios during any Middle East crisis.

## V. Financial Markets & Intelligence

**Role:** Financial markets function as **distributed real-time prediction machines** — they aggregate expectations about future political and economic outcomes. Monitoring them alongside news creates a leading vs. lagging indicator framework, where market moves often *precede* political developments.

> **v2.0 Update:** The commodity derivatives layer has been explicitly added. v1.0 was strong for equities and sovereign debt but weak on crude oil futures, LNG futures, and shipping insurance — the most direct financial indicators of a Middle East energy crisis. WTI (West Texas Intermediate) and Brent crude futures are now designated as primary monitoring instruments alongside VIX during any Middle East or energy-adjacent event.

## VI. Non-English & Non-Western Sources

**Role:** Critical for avoiding **Anglophone epistemic capture** — the tendency to mistake Western media consensus for global reality. These sources provide alternative framings, local political dynamics, and information systematically underreported in Western outlets.

> **State media caveat:** RT, Xinhua, and Global Times should never be used as factual sources. Their value is strictly as **official narrative trackers** — they reveal what the Russian and Chinese governments want the world to believe, which is itself analytically important.

> **v2.0 Additions:** Persian-language and Iranian civil society sources have been added — a critical gap identified in the Iran strike analysis. Israel Hayom has been added to represent the Netanyahu coalition’s internal strategic logic, which differs materially from Haaretz’s critical framing.

## VII. Early Warning Indexes & Quantitative Dashboards

**Role:** Indexes are composite quantitative measures that aggregate multiple variables into a single score or ranking. They function as **early warning systems (EWS)** — signals that precede visible political or economic deterioration. This is where analysis transitions from *descriptive* to *anticipatory*.

> **Key distinction — Leading vs. Lagging Indicators:**
>
> - *Leading indicators* move **before** the broader economy or political event (e.g., PMI, VIX, CDS spreads, tanker flows)
> - *Lagging indicators* confirm trends **after** they occur (e.g., GDP, unemployment rate)
>
> Prioritize leading indicators for early decision-making.

> **v2.0 Additions:** BDTI (Baltic Dirty Tanker Index) has been added as the primary crude supply disruption leading indicator, complementing the existing BDI. A new “Compound Vulnerability Framework” has been added as a structured analytical tool for identifying optimal-window geopolitical escalation scenarios.

### D. Compound Vulnerability Framework *(NEW — v2.0)*

> **Definition:** A *compound vulnerability window* occurs when a state targeted for coercive action experiences simultaneous deterioration across military, economic, and political dimensions. Historical analysis of the 2026 Iran strike reveals that such windows — not rhetorical triggers like nuclear program developments — are the primary determinant of *when* military action occurs. The nuclear program was the *justification*; the compound vulnerability was the *timing trigger*.

**How to use:** Score target states across the three dimensions below. When all three score “HIGH” simultaneously, a compound vulnerability window exists. This is when deterrence-dependent states face maximum exposure and when coercive actors face minimum expected retaliation cost.

|Dimension                  |Indicators to Monitor                                                                                                                                                  |Signal Sources                                                                                |Window Signal                                                                                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Military Vulnerability** |Air defense degradation; missile production capacity losses; proxy network attrition (Hezbollah, Hamas, etc.); time since last strike (capability reconstitution phase)|IISS Military Balance; ACLED; CFR Global Conflict Tracker; DIA assessments (when declassified)|HIGH: Proxies destroyed; air defense degraded; < 12 months since last major strike                         |
|**Economic Vulnerability** |Currency collapse (rial equivalent); banking system insolvency signals; foreign reserve depletion; inflation rate; sanction exposure                                   |BIS; IMF Article IV; Atlantic Council GeoEconomics; EIA (oil revenue dependency)              |HIGH: Currency down >30% YoY; multiple bank insolvency reports; no IMF access; inflation >40%              |
|**Political Vulnerability**|Protest scale and durability; regime legitimacy signals; security force loyalty; succession uncertainty                                                                |IranWire; Radio Farda; FSI; Freedom House; Google Trends (domestic search spikes); ACLED      |HIGH: Protests >50 cities; credible reports of security force defections; leadership succession uncertainty|

## VIII. Trump Behavior Prediction Stack

**Analytical framing:** Predicting Trump’s decisions requires a distinct source architecture from standard political monitoring. His decision pattern is driven less by institutional process and more by **personal grievance cycles, media feedback loops, donor/ally pressure, and legal self-interest**. The key is triangulating across sources that have demonstrated *track records of accuracy* — not ideological alignment.

> **Core methodological insight:** Left-leaning sources often break negative Trump stories first but overestimate institutional resistance. Right-leaning sources underestimate intra-coalition fractures but have superior access to his actual intentions. Both are necessary — neither alone is sufficient.

> **v2.0 Lessons from the Iran Strike:**
>
> 1. The **market crash → policy reversal** heuristic remains the single most reliable constraint on Trump escalation — even when he has publicly committed to military action. Trump signaled openness to Iran talks *within 48 hours* of commencing strikes, after learning that Iran’s “new leadership wants to speak with him.” Monitor the S&P 500 and crude oil simultaneously.
> 1. The **ally lobby → policy shift** pattern was demonstrated at maximum intensity: Netanyahu’s February 2026 Washington visit appears to have been the proximate trigger for the strike decision. A close Netanyahu-Trump meeting within 2 weeks of a foreign policy action should be treated as a pre-decision signal.
> 1. **Negotiation as cover** is now a documented pattern, not a hypothesis: Trump authorized the largest US military operation in the Middle East since 2003 *while simultaneously conducting nuclear negotiations* with Iran. Diplomatic process does not constrain military planning under this administration.

### D. Behavioral & Predictive Analytical Tools

> **Prediction markets** are real-money or reputation-staked betting platforms where participants forecast political outcomes. They are historically more accurate than polls because participants bear a direct cost — financial or reputational — for being wrong.

## IX. Social Media Trend Monitoring & AI Manipulation Analysis

**Role:** Social media is no longer merely a *reflection* of public opinion — it is an **active shaping environment** where narratives are manufactured, amplified, and geolocated. The central analytical challenge is distinguishing **organic sentiment** from **CIB (Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior)** — the term of art for bot networks, troll farms, and AI-generated influence operations.

> **Key terms:**
>
> - *CIB (Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior)* — organized campaigns using fake or automated accounts to artificially amplify specific narratives
> - *Synthetic media* — AI-generated images, video (deepfakes), audio (voice cloning), and text designed to deceive
> - *Narrative laundering* — the process by which a false or manipulated claim migrates from fringe sources to mainstream outlets through citation chains

### D. Real-Time Manipulation Detection Framework

A field-applicable checklist for identifying coordinated or AI-generated manipulation in real time. Apply to any viral or rapidly spreading claim before acting on it.

|Signal                                 |Indicator                                        |What to Watch                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Narrative velocity**                 |Anomalous spread speed relative to source quality|Authentic stories build gradually; manufactured ones spike artificially with no credible origin            |
|**Account age + posting frequency**    |Bot signature                                    |New accounts posting at superhuman frequency on a single topic within hours of creation                    |
|**Cross-platform simultaneity**        |Coordinated amplification                        |Same exact phrase appearing across platforms within minutes = likely coordinated origin                    |
|**Emotional valence**                  |Outrage engineering                              |Manipulation systematically targets high-arousal emotions (rage, fear) over information delivery           |
|**Source laundering chain**            |Narrative laundering                             |Trace: fringe site → aggregator → mainstream outlet citation; always verify to primary source              |
|**Synthetic image artifacts**          |AI-generated visuals                             |Examine hands, backgrounds, text in images; verify with Hive or Sensity for high-stakes content            |
|**LLM-style prose**                    |AI-generated text                                |Uniform sentence structure, absence of idiosyncrasy, high perplexity scores — use GPTZero or Originality.ai|
|**Missing byline or vague attribution**|Source opacity                                   |Credible journalism has named authors with verifiable track records                                        |
|**Geopolitical timing**                |Strategic information release                    |Breaking stories that emerge precisely at geopolitically opportune moments warrant heightened skepticism   |

## X. Integrated Monitoring Workflow

A structured cadence for consuming this source stack without cognitive overload. The goal is to match **analytical time horizon** to **source update frequency**.

> **Key failure modes to avoid:**
>
> - *Information overload* — consuming too many sources without a processing framework, leading to noise overwhelming signal
> - *Recency bias* — over-weighting the latest event relative to structural trends
> - *Confirmation bias* — preferentially consuming sources that confirm existing priors
> - *Anglophone epistemic capture* — mistaking Western media consensus for global reality *(added v2.0)*
> - *Negotiation optimism bias* — assuming diplomatic process constrains military planning *(added v2.0, validated by Iran strike)*

|**Negotiation optimism bias**   |Assuming diplomatic process constrains military planning; treating talks as a reliable off-ramp signal                                          |When military buildup co-occurs with diplomatic process, treat military buildup as the leading indicator                                                 |
|**Nuclear pretext conflation**  |Accepting nuclear program justifications at face value without examining whether the operational target set is consistent with stated objectives|Compare stated justification (nuclear sites) with actual targets struck; decapitation strikes = regime-change objective                                  |

|**Energy market blindspot**     |Failing to monitor commodity derivatives and shipping data during geopolitical events                                                           |During any Middle East event, activate the full Section IV energy layer immediately — do not wait for media reporting to surface the oil market dimension|
